So I bought more plugins (AutoCast, AutoApps, AutoVoice, AutoInput) and I\\'m still not able to do what I originally set out to do, which was to shuffle a specific Spotify playlist on Google Home/Nest speakers at a certain time each day. I personally didn\\'t find the documentation and tutorials particularly helpful. It mostly consists of Youtube videos of someone creating very specific tasks, but too quickly and without needed context or explanation. I\\'m sure with enough experience people are able to create awesome tasks with this, but it\\'s a steep learning curve. I\\'ve spent several hours on this, researching, experimenting, trying different stuff, and I can only do the most basic stuff like changing the volume of a Google Nest speaker. In my opinion this should be one app with all the functionality, not 50 apps with the functionality fragmented between them. Updated with more stars: I think my previous review may have been a bit harsh. I didn\\'t realize some of the challenges faced by the new developer, and they were very responsive to my email.

Block phone calls and text messages from unknown numbers. 3. Automatically save my GPS location every time I park my car. 4. Update my daily alarm to the newest episode of my favorite podcast (shout out to KEXP Song of the Day!). 5. Auto-connect to my VPN whenever I'm not on my home network. Tasker is easy to learn and it’s simple to dive right in. A number of forums are available for support and inspiration. It is also important to note that Tasker is under active development. João does a great job of keeping up with Google's newest updates. 5 stars for the app, and another 5 for João. You won’t be disappointed.\", 'Been using it for years.

There is a great community of users online that share different profiles they've created, with walk-throughs on how to load them. it's easy to see why this app has over a million downloads. I've seen articles mentioning over FIVE million downloads. In 8 years, I've had one issue. The issue was caused by an android upgrade. I reached out to the developer in a link on the app and he contacted me with the fix a few hours later. Not days... HOURS.

Great App, Super Support.', \"Really great app. You can do so much with it. Your imagination is the limit. And if something doesn't work with this app there are a ton of plugins. It's really fun to test new things and finally find a solution that works.

The developer seems to be a great guy and honestly I don't know how he manages to support, update and upgrade so many apps.\", \"I don't know why I waited so long to finally try this app -- maybe I just wasn't ready to have my mind utterly blown! In all seriousness, the claim that this app can automate everything actually does mean *everything*. One piece of constructive feedback, though; the UI can definitely be improved. Editing a task's control flow can be particularly slow and painful (especially where there are if statements), which can make testing and debugging quite tedious.

The UI makes sense once you understand how the app works, but it's still a bit clunky, and brings down my rating from 7 to 5 stars. Overall: love it.\", \"Tasker is without a doubt the best paid app I have ever purchased. I use it to toggle my WiFi on in certain places (home, school, etc.) and off when I leave those places, put my phone on do not disturb mode when I connect to my car's Bluetooth system, automatically silence my phone when I'm in certain locations (library, work, etc.) or on certain calendar events (I keep a Google calendar just for my phone silencing schedule, so I never have to worry about silencing my phone before class or remember to un-silence it after class). And that only begins to scratch the surface of what Tasker is capable of. Tasker is far more powerful than you can imagine, and I really want to take a weekend sometime soon to get elbow-deep in it and do some complex automation. Note that WiFi toggling requires an extra step as Google doesn't allow new updates on the Play Store to touch WiFi directly; just contact the developer and he'll walk you through the easy steps.\", \"Absolute must have for automating your life.

In addition to the fun and satisfaction of the automatisms created, I was also able to count on João's quick and professional support in case of problems or to make up for the shortcomings of Google and its new APIs. You deserve at least 5 stars.\", \"Great app!

If I knew it before, it would have saved so much time for me. I am not going to describe what this app can do in this review, since, it can do so many things. Just as they say, it's only limited by your imagination. Sometimes, I found there are many apps in the market, or preinstalled on my phone, which are doing pretty good job.

Tasker has proven to be a great way to do complex things on a phone that is over-managed by paranoid IT departments. Tasker is so good I have used it to replace almost all of my custom apps on my other personal devices too because Tasker is simply easier to deal with.

Tasker has much better potential choices and configurables, but it will take a while for me to learn how to do things again.', \"I'm going to list some of the things I have done with tasker to show examples of how it has helped me and how vastly useful it is. --------------------------When I park at my gym, it will automatically display my gym's QR code on my phone. When I park at my movie theater, it displays my movie membership QR code and silences my phone (and restores the volume when I'm back in my car after the movie). ----------------------I made it so if I long-press my bixby button, my phone turns into a remote control for my lights in my room. And if I point my phone at a light and tilt the phone up, the light will brighten. If I tilt the phone down, the light I'm pointing at will dim. -------------------Made my phone stop searching for Wifi if I'm connected to car bluetooth so that it doesn't waste battery or ask to connect to random restaurant hotspots when I'm trying to give directions -----------------------Because I work underground where there aren't windows, I like to know how the weather/traffic is outside before I leave work. So I added a feature to my home screen which fetches live photos taken from street cams around me, so I can quickly see if there's traffic or stormy weather before I head out. --------------------Designed a night-time process for my lights: they will dim down and change color for 15 minutes, and then turn off. I use it every night and I always love falling asleep to it. Also, using Join I can trigger this from either my phone OR my laptop. I have tons of lights-related tasker conveniences. For example, every day Tasker finds out when sunset is, so that it can start turning my lights on automatically one hour before sunset. --------------------When i wasn't happy with any music players on my phone, I literally made my own lightweight music player using Tasker's UI-building tools. And I can summon it whenever I want by pressing a Tasker-made button on the navbar at the bottom of my screen, I don't even have to go to the home screen to open it. --------------------I programmed Tasker to store tallies of how many minutes I spend driving each week, and how long I spend at my gym each day. It's fun looking back at this kind of data. ------------------I attached NFC tags to my pot plants. Each plant needs to be watered at a different schedule, and Tasker will alert me if a plant has gone too long without watering. When I water it, I just have to hold my phone to the tag on the plant's pot and it'll mark it as freshly watered. ------------------I made a short visual sequence that makes it look like my phone has glitched up and deleted hundreds of files. It hasn't really, but it's fun to see people's reactions when they think they've done something that broke my phone. -----------OKAY: NOW GENERAL THOUGHTS------------ Those are some easy-to-explain examples of projects I've done with tasker, but there are many more that I'm proud of. Finding and solving problems using Tasker feels extremely rewarding. When I got the hang of it, I viewed my phone in a new light. I started to realize there were inconveniences with my phone that Tasker could mend. And I started seeing tools offered by Tasker that I could use to create useful ways to control my phone. My only problem with Tasker is that it is hard to drag and drop items to rearrange the order of your actions, because it does not make it clear where the item will land (and for some reason it doesn't usually drop it between the two items you dragged it to). This is a frustration I desperately hope will be fixed, but sadly it doesn't seem like a priority. Nonetheless, the app is easily the most powerful and useful app I've ever used. If you don't have any programming skills it doesn't matter, you don't need them to get some insane usage out of tasker. If you do have interest or skills in programming, your options open exponentially. There may be competing apps that try to fill the same role as Tasker, but Tasker is the undisputed king.\", \"I have had a few problems but the Developer has been a great help. Such a simple fix in the end but its knowing what to do to sort it. So with DEVELOPER turned on you need DON'T KEEP ACTIVITIES should be DISABLED. Simple as that and all now working.

Update (Answer): Almost all parts of the apps. I understand this app is for pro users and most pro users would get it. But just imagine if you show the screenshots of the app to someone and ask what's happening here, most of them wouldn't quite get it. Having said that, I do not have any solution as well but one example I can give is Automate app. The way it shows the flows with a flowchart makes it easier to understand whats happening. Also, consider I am creating a profile and I don't know where the exact trigger lies i.e. is it under applications, day, event or god knows. There can be a simpler way of searching through the triggers the way you have for action category dialog. The fact that many people have to ask a question on how to create some particular task, itself is a smell that the UI can be more intuitive.  Nevertheless, I agree that it has improved a lot over the years and the feature set it offers is unmatched. All the best devs.\", 'So pleased with this app. When I first downloaded it, it seemed a bit too difficult to use, but I sat down and actually tried it out (and read the docs, haha) and it is incredible.

Two of my biggest complaints, specifically lack of copy-paste for profiles/tasks/actions and multiple If-Then conditionals, have recently been addressed...this is a *huge* help and avoids having to use Maths and Variable Set/Add/Subtract for the same functionality.  The Bad: Takes an incredible amount of effort to learn and can be unreliable.  Debugging can be extremely frustrating, especially if profiles or tasks conflict.  There is no way to trace bugs for complex logic other than using Flash toasts which can get messy or complicated, and the logging function gives too much information.  Documentation is bare-bones and doesn\\'t do a good job of explaining the more complex functions.  Examples and tutorials are often based on older versions or are so obtuse you\\'d already have to know how to do something in order to understand it (which defeats the purpose of a tutorial).  Some very useful tools, such as manual profile/task order and category pages, are difficult to find and enable.  Recommendations for the Developer: I highly recommend a \"Comment\" type function for tasks and profiles.  You can label individual actions but it would be nice to be able to create a full text explanation of what the heck a profile or task does.  I would add additional logic functions, especially something like \"Select Case\" to avoid having large decision trees using If-End If-Stop/Goto.  I would also like to see a \"debug log\" (you can sort of use the Write to File function but it requires you to create seperate tasks just to manage it).  Finally, it would be nice to have more examples or even prebuilt tasks for common uses of Tasker...for a new user it\\'s often hard to figure out how to do some of the more useful tasks.  Overall: Quite possibly the most important, but potentially useless, program you can buy for your Android phone.  If you can figure out how to utilize it the applications will change the way you interact with your phone forever.  If you can\\'t, it\\'s pretty much worthless.

The videos showing what people have done with the app, the options, just wow, it's like having a key to the inner workings of Android and your device, but when you actually try to do something, you encounter the horrible UI. I tried most of the automating apps from Llama, Automagic Automation (current favourite), AutomateIt, Autooma, MacroDroid, Condi, etc and surely the devs from Tasker could do better in the UI department.   Try the following in Tasker: Headset plugged in triggers a music app and simulates the play button. At the same time it loads a second function that allows me to control the music player by either shakes, gestures or sensors depending on the orientation and location of the device. if I unplug the headset, it stops the music, stop the second function and kills the music app if I don't connect the headset back after some time.

I was shocked on how unintuitive it was, but I still managed to create some useful profiles. It feels too complex and confusing for the beginner, yet doesnt have the power features to justify the complexity. It feels like a quirky programming language from the 80s.

You never know if what tou did will be saved because there is no save button. Instead, you have to hope that pressing the back doesn't result in you losing all your progress. I like the Holo look, but I would prefer to have the old app back.

This is one POWERFUL automation tool but the learning curve is fairly STEEP and there are some limitations.  It's a lot like high level programming and will be over the head of some non-programming oriented end users but root and power users will love it.\", 'Most value for money app out there! However, the latest update does something odd with the widgets. They now get resized and squashed when put into the dock with nova launcher.', \"Couldn't manage without it anymore. It's even fun to come up with new tasks. The beginner mode is super easy to learn. Dunno what some peeps are fussing over the UI being difficult so much.\", \"Tasker is amazing. I use it to manage WiFi states and ringer volumes based on time and location, and along with the Secure Settings app to automatically disable my phone's PIN at home and other trusted locations.  Tasker's feature set is so vast that it can be a little intimidating at first. But once you begin to explore the options, the gears in your brain will start spinning, thinking of creative ways to use it.

Honestly it seems clean and easy to follow and I have seen much worse.  The only problem I have with this app is that it seems I have to back ALLLL the way out of the app to save my new tasks.  Not a big problem if I remember, but it seems unintuitive if that was on purpose.\", \"First thing I tried to do with this app upon installing was set it to show a popup when the phone is charging wirelessly.

Reboot the phone or tablet nightly so it runs at about equal speed each day.  Set a sensor to put the phone into silent mode when turned upside down.  Set the phone app to hang up a call if placed upside down while on the call.  Put the phone into speakerphone mode when set flat facing up on a table.  You can set it to do things based on any number of things like launch an app at a time of day or lock the screen when charging, etc.  You can do multiple tasks too!\", 'I have downloaded this app and have tried several webpage is that teach you how to use it.

Gives amazing options of customizing a phone. Truly an excellent app and the developer has done a fantastic job. But for a beginner, here there is a rider. After initial easy profiles, if you have to create more innovative profiles, you have to spend some time, learn how to use variables etc which for a person who is not a software engineer/programmer (like me) will take some time. A detailed user manual for a beginner is difficult to get (I know there are some step-by-step how to articles, but found them still bit technical). But gist of the story is you have to put in good amount of effort and time to learn it (worth it considering the potential of this app). 4 stars because interface is bit technical (understandably so).', 'Pretty hard to tame the beast, if you want to go a bit deeper.

For instance, before I could turn my wifi off--now I cannot. I can't turn it off at all. It just says that APN doesn't work on my phone (a nexus 4). I am really upset about it considering how much I used this app before. Anything that uses an APN in Tasker now no longer works.

Tasker's learning curve remains formidable, though, and at some point you wonder if it wouldn't be easier if it had a scripting language instead of a Byzantine UI.  There are also some curious omissions. You can create a menu, for example, but I don't see any way to reorder the items in it (this was easy when menus were tasks, but they're not anymore). Also, when adding a Load App action to a menu, you'd think it would fill in the app's icon and name automatically, but it doesn't, so basically you have to pick the app twice.
