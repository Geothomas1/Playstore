I allready tried to contact them through the application itself many times but that was not of any use. They say to mail your complaint and when I do that they say to update the application, but I'm using the latest version2.21.5.17\", 'Why is it that this app expires so fast?! Why is it that when it expires then updating/installing another one becomes so difficult, takes to long and when you finally succeed in installing another one it comes back without the messages?! This is very disappointing and discouraging please do something about this, I believe you can always do better than this. Thanks in advance.', \"It would be great if two new features could be added. First - the option to remain offline while chatting so that one can save themselves from obligatory conversations. Second to separate the numbers and groups into two types- professional and personal. So that on weekends one will feel quite relaxed if they don't get to see the messages in bulk.\", 'Most third class app I have ever seen. First of all the media is not visible in galary though my media visibility is on. Second the messages is not send quickly though I have enough good internet connection. Third when I send more than one picture, the picture is not gone serial wise and the other person experience a big trouble. I always hate this app. As my all groups are in this app I use it otherwise I will uninstall.', \"This WhatsApp is wow!!! I left the one star out because it hasn't good features which GB and other WhatsApp have. Plus sometimes the call scrambles(Reconnecting). Aside that, I think it's good. No errors like WhatsApp has stopped working which the GB/other WhatsApp do. If you update it like those other WhatsApp, you'll surely get lotta 5stars and users\", 'When opening the application have to type every alphabet individually as the qwerty keypad gets withdrawn every single time. Also app gets crashed without touching anything. If videos are played only 2 3 seconds of playback is possible after that app gets crashed.This issue is only for Whatsapp application and not for any other applications. Forced to give single star for the same found out that multiple people are facing the same..', \"I didn't like this new latest version, 1. Due to media files are not gets deleted even if deleted just instantly once viewed. 2. Also previous version was better to manage storage including chat, voice, video, images doc, linke all such options are better to do. 3. Enter key is gets disabled from keyword in new version, whereas it's gets active in all other apps. 4. Day by day watts app is becoming commercials.\", \"Amazing app I use it every day I really recommend it. Update suggestions: -in groups add a mention even for people who aren't in the group; -Add some more smiley emojis; -Add a built-in sticker creator in the stickers section, because most of the sticker maker apps are awful, useless and/or not compatible with many phones.

The video quality is terrible and it disconnects when me and the recipient of my call has proper connection. We can even message each other yet it disconnects.

And the latest update the option for 'delete for everyone' is being removed .. Please fix it back to that option\", \"should add few more features,like whatsapp should have a feature of posting pictures which should last forever(same as IG)along with a privacy where only select people could see one's pictures,story which get posted should get archive after disappearing (after 24hours). thank you 💗 that's alot you should add on otherwise whatsapp is doing great 👌🏻👌🏻\", \"Im using whatsapp more than 5 years... But today it's not working properly. Even I'm having a proper network it's not working. Otherthan whatsapp every other apps are working properly.. there is no problem with my network.

I am very disappointed with this...\", \"I think when posting video at status, the image and the audio isn't very well sync please fix this.. I'll give 5 star if you fix it Edit : more problem I can't delete all of the video and picture at manage storage.. I have to do it manually which is super annoying and hard to do, honestly it's just wasting my time, fix this or give me a solution to it\", \"It would be much more personal if the archived chats would have been hidden even if the person sends you messages, I mean it doesn't show the messages, unless I want it to be seen by searching the name of the contact or at least by unlocking a contact, etc. Again there is no locked or secret chat with a specific contact so that no one would see it on the list of What's app chats!!\", \"Frustrating time out of Connection with other person. Screen display timeout of phone is 10 min, but WhatsApp disconnects Audio entirely. Echoes, poor audio, and annoying bugs . dev needs to fix Connection issues that are unresolved online experienced by others also.

Sometime WhatsApp can't connect with network, On last 2 updates WhatsApp suddenly can't find backup file from G-drive.Because whatsapp is automatically erasing backups when I'm uninstalling it.

Duo, viber, imo is working properly. I thought it was my network problm but it’s yours.\", 'Dear Developers, Kindly check below suggestions. *While sending photos Captions is not working properly. *Please add Ping vibration option. *Please allow us to copy selected text from the complete msg. *Can we get a mark or something where we able to know which contact is already in group or broadcast while adding. *Some emojis not shows & some changes the the color after sent.', 'If you are in a call or if you are writing a text message to someone and if you get another whatsapp notification, it crashes.

I'm seriously annoyed. Atleast notify when you're about to do something to the server! I lost all my chats now! I had backup, it shows that there's a backup of 1.8 GB but in no time its completed and all I get it empty chats and unknown contacts! Worst! I hate WhatsApp!\", \"Its a great and amazing bonding app but there is 1 thing that irritates me the most it is when you see a person's status and u really like it and want to save it but u can't cuz status only stays for 24 hrs.So in my opinion there should be status downloading option in which if you like the status and want to save it u can download it. So plss WhatsApp consider my request and pls add a downloading option in status. Overall the app is amazing for those ppl who are looking for an conversational app\", \"Why cant I no longer crop (not trim) videos while sending/uploading to status? Why have you guys started removing useful features just like Apple? Kindly bring it back in the next update. Update: Can't take picture on WhatsApp camera. Something is seriously wrong with you guys. Greed and power have taken over your souls.\", \"A very useful and user friendly app. I would recommend the developers to add a feature in which we can pin a particular message in a chat which we have to refer every now and then so that we don't have to scroll all the way up to locate that particular message. For eg. Sometimes a link to join an online recurring meeting is shared in a group chat which we need to refer to in order to join that particular meeting. To do that we have to scroll to that particular message everytime we need to join.\", 'i think theres a LOT to add 1. custom chat themes! to make colorful chat themes that match with ur wallpaper, it makes it attractive and using aesthetic things feels good too 2. a feature for editing ur messages 3. not sending the \"this message was deleted\" sign when u delete a message 💀💀 so yea, and i rlly like the new wallpaper update, so whatsapp is definitely getting better, lets make it the best!', 'Amazing app... I had a suggestion. When im on audio call 📞 my ear touches a screen and there is a icon to add more ppl on that call interface at top right of the screen so it is clicking on that icon and den automatically selects the first contact and tries to connect. I wud suggest if u can re-locate that button to bottom of the screen.', \"It's a wonderful apps that I've been using ever since 2016. But it would be even more wondrous if we can pin more than 3 groups (speaking from a student's point of view when you have tons of seemingly all important groups).\", \"If I am on call the other person wouldn't know that I am on another call. It should intimate the other person that I am on call so they may stop calling. And the status post, there must be some privacy like close friends option on instagram. For example if I post something, i should have an option to set up who can view my status.\", \"I use Infinix HOT 10 and I hv updated the app right now and it's crashing.

I can't seem to talk to someone for more the a minute before it starts buffering. Its really irritating to me and the caller because we can't have a decent conversation. Please fix it.\", 'WhatsApp is a very good way to send messages. There is something missing on WhatsApp such as No one insists on their group without permission. Quality is deteriorated when sending photos. The option to send real photos is not given. . There is no option to lock every chat separately. The company should focus on these things.', \"It's been confusing, but I think it's also useful. Hopefully to get a better treatment hence forth. Rating this medium of communication has been useful for all both National and International. So it deserves a good merit from us all, that is why I'll give it a very good merit that it deserves. Furthermore, considering the treatment I've received so far till now, they worth been given a four stars even the whole five stars.
